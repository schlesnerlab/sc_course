During this course we will learn how to:

## Prerequisites
Some very basic R knowledge is assumed. If you are not familiar with the R statistical programming language we strongly encourage you to work through an introductory R course, for example this [r-crash-course](https://bioinformatics-core-shared-training.github.io/r-crash-course/), which should take around 1 hour.
